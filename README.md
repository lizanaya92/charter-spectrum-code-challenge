To search using the search bar, simply type in the name, city, or genre of the restaurant you are looking for. Press the "Search" button and your results will be displayed. To reset the results, clear the search box and you will automatically be back to the home page.

To use filters, click on the "Filter by" button. You can use the filters by themselves or in combination with the search bar. To search using the filters, use the "Apply Filters" button to complete your search. Using the "Close Filters" button will set the filters to default without displaying results. You can clear filters and return to the homepage by clicking "Clear Filters".

Enjoy the website and your delicious meal! :yum:
